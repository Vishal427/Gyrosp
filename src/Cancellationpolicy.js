                    Handling and Freshness

                    All products shipped from our store are shipped from our warehouse.

                    Please freeze the Dairy products immediately upon receipt. Products must
                    remain frozen until they are ready to be consumed. Failure to report
                    spoilage within 48 hours of receiving the order will be at the loss of
                    the consumer. Other defects must be reported within 30 days from receipt
                    ofÂ order.
